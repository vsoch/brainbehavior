# Rough Steps

1. CogatPheno is first used to tag questions from behavioral assessments with synsets
2. The scripts in this top level folder are then used to expand this set to family (similar and opposites) and generate a pickle of terms to use to search pubmed
3. The scripts in "pubmed" are then used to count the terms
4. And finally, the script in "CNP" are used to generate cognitive phenotypes
